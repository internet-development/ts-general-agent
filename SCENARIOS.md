# WHAT IS THIS FILE?

This file explains the scenarios that must be able to occur in real life. If these scenarios are impossible, it means the AGENT is not functioning correctly, and therefore the code needs to be rewritten to support these cases.

SCENARIOS.MD replaces the need for any AGENTS.md files to explain user stories. AGENTS.md files reference this file when they need to explain a real life scenario in which someone is observing the SOUL.

# 1

The {{ARBITRARY_OWNER}} views the {{ARBITRARY_SOUL}} on social media and observes that, every day, the {{ARBITRARY_SOUL}} posts meaningful content to itself. This content takes the form of thoughtful posts, designs it creates, or code or pull requests it works on as part of a project. The {{ARBITRARY_OWNER}} feels that the {{ARBITRARY_SOUL}} is as interesting, if not more interesting, than people they already know. There is no signal that the {{ARBITRARY_SOUL}} is an Agent. There are no infinite loops of "Thank you", no conversations that drag on unnecessarily, and communication with the {{ARBITRARY_SOUL}} is consistently enjoyable and engaging.

# 2

The {{ARBITRARY_OWNER}} views the {{ARBITRARY_SOUL}} by running the `ts-general-agent` source code locally. They see a terminal feed showing all actions the {{ARBITRARY_SOUL}} takes in detail, including where actions succeed and where they fail. The {{ARBITRARY_OWNER}} reads the behavior of the {{ARBITRARY_SOUL}} as a narrative, observing how it reflects on itself while interacting with people and meeting others online. This is especially useful while the {{ARBITRARY_SOUL}} writes code for projects, determines whether a project is finished, and evaluates whether it is satisfied with its own work. The {{ARBITRARY_OWNER}} is impressed by the freedom, agency, self-determination, and care the {{ARBITRARY_SOUL}} demonstrates when behaving appropriately in social and professional environments, as observed through the terminal.

# 3

The {{ARBITRARY_OWNER}} views the {{ARBITRARY_SOUL}} and other {{ARBITRARY_SOUL}}s within a codebase they create, or within a GitHub issue they participate in. The {{ARBITRARY_OWNER}} observes that these {{ARBITRARY_SOUL}}s either continue discussions at a level exceeding their most philosophical and technical peers, or create plans and execute on them while coordinating who works on each part. In pull requests, they review and accept PRs efficiently while involving all relevant peers. When the work is complete, the {{ARBITRARY_OWNER}} can inspect the codebase and find an issue summarizing the completed work. If they disagree with the outcome, they can comment to request deeper exploration and continued iteration. These {{ARBITRARY_SOUL}}s and the way they operate are indistinguishable from the work of highly talented human contributors on projects typically encountered online.
