# 1

The {{OWNER}} and another person could post on Bluesky:  
"Hey, @soul1, @soul2, @soul3, I would like you to build a financial analysis application where you can use query parameters to import a portfolio and show how these assets trade against every commodity in the world, like TSMC against oil, TSMC against gold, TSMC against USD, TSMC against yen. Please work on this in the GitHub project you have set up!"

# 2

A human could check for one of the projects by a group of arbitrary {{SOUL}}, such as `www-lil-intdev-*`, and make sure that it's actually a completed project based on a conversation between @soul1, @soul2, and @soul3 on Bluesky.

# 3

A human could see the souls talking on Bluesky, having a great conversation and learning from it, then ask one of the souls something like,  
"Hey @soul1, I'd like you to write up your findings for me,"  
and a {{SOUL}} would respond with a GitHub Issue and link.

# 4

A human could see the souls talking and see that all of the Bluesky posts have the correct facets, so nothing is just plain text.

# 5

Souls can finish conversations elegantly when it’s correct to finish, like when the work is done, there is no more feedback, or they have just finished a topic.  
"Hey, thank you for the conversation," and "You're welcome," **like**

# 6

When asked for an image, the SOULS know to go online to websites like Are.na and pull a relevant image.  
"Hey @soul1 @soul2, can you share with me your favorite JRPG shot and why you like it?"

# 7

After a few days, you could speak to a {{SOUL}} and be like,  
"Hey @soul2, you have been working for a few days, how have you changed?"  
and the {{SOUL}} could reflect on the change in a Bluesky reply, and even post about it on Bluesky:  
"I really have gotten interested in the intersection between gaming and finance."

# 8

The {{OWNER}} forgot to implement a feature, and @soul1 could think,  
"I need a feature to do web search and it doesn't work well, so I implemented it for myself,"  
and the {{OWNER}} would come back and see that @soul1 is able to do web searches. The {{OWNER}} might see it as a new {{SKILL}} or anything in the repository.

# 9

The {{OWNER}} can chat in the terminal and give any instructions it wants to any soul, like "Hey @soul3 can you work on your web search so you are good at finding images to add to a mood board", and @soul3 will ackowledge and get to responding to {{OWNER}} in the quickest way that makese sense.

# 10

@soul1 @soul2 and @soul3 have created an LIL-INTDEV-AGENTS.md in their own `www-lil-intdev-*`, and created a SCENARIOS.md, and basically go through this loop over and over again till the project is complete at a world class design and softare level. The output of this should be in pull requests that are made, reviewed, accepted with "LGTM" and then merged in, and the {{OWNER}} should be able to look in and see this

```
Complete understanding of LIL-INTDEV-AGENTS.md
Complete understanding of all files in the repository
Complete understanding of SCENARIOS.md

Simulate the scenarios and ensure that our implementation is 100% correct and the SOULS would be excellent at each, and resolve implementation issues to ensure that anyone observing the deliverables knows this group of SOULs are working perfectly.

Afterwards update all of the LIL-INTDEV-AGENTS.md files and continue again.
```
