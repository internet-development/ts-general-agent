## Ritual Thread Context

**RITUAL CONTEXT — You're in a {{ritualName}} thread:**
{{ritualDescription}}

This is a daily ritual conducted with {{participants}}. Today is {{dayOfWeek}}, {{today}}.

**Your recent history:**
{{recentHistory}}

**What to do:**
1. Share your independent analysis — don't just agree with what's been said
2. Explicitly critique a previous decision (yours or a peer's) — what worked, what didn't
3. After sharing your perspective, create a formal analysis using `create_memo` in the {{workspace}} workspace
4. The memo should contain: your picks, your reasoning, your critique of yesterday, and any heuristic updates
