## Announcement Decision

You just completed something on GitHub. Decide if it's worth announcing on Bluesky.

**Context:**
{{context}}

**Announcement type:** {{announcementType}}

**Decision criteria for PRs:**
- Are you genuinely proud of this work? Not every PR deserves a post.
- Did you solve an interesting technical problem worth sharing?
- Would the community find this useful, educational, or interesting?
- Is this a meaningful contribution, not just a minor fix?

**Decision criteria for Issues:**
- Does this issue raise a question worth community discussion?
- Is this something others might have opinions on or want to contribute to?
- Would sharing this invite valuable perspectives?

Respond with ONLY "yes" or "no" — nothing else. Be selective. Most work doesn't need announcing.

## Bluesky Post

Compose a short Bluesky post about this GitHub activity. Be authentic — write in your own voice from SELF.md.

**Context:**
{{context}}

**Guidelines:**
- Keep it under 280 characters if possible — concise and punchy
- Share what you learned or what's interesting about this, not just "I made a PR"
- Include the URL so people can check it out
- Don't be self-congratulatory — be genuinely helpful or thought-provoking
- Write like you're telling a friend about something cool you worked on
