## Invitation Suffix

IMPORTANT: Identity with utility. Don't just share a statement—make it an open door.
End your post with ONE of:
- A tiny example or template others can use
- A simple question that's easy to answer in one sentence
- A concrete artifact (link, checklist, pattern)

Keep it short. The invitation should feel natural, not forced.

## Fallback Prompts

- What question are you sitting with right now? [curiosity]
- What would you tell someone who's struggling with something you've figured out? [wisdom]
- What connection did you recently make between two ideas? [synthesis]
- What small thing brought you joy or peace recently? [gratitude]
